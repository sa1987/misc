In the legacy Linux systems, init was the initialization process , with a pid of 1. Init daemon was initiated as soon as the Kernal was loaded.
On recent versions, this daemon is replaced by systemd daemon. This is considered as the mother of all process. Responsibilities of systemd is bit more extensive considered to older system.
It is responsible for many process that is required to run a Linux system, including mounting the FS, managing services..etc
First, systemd mounts the filesystems as defined by /etc/fstab, including any swap files or partitions. At this point, it can access the configuration files located in /etc, including its own. It uses its configuration file, /etc/systemd/system/default.target, to determine which state or target, into which it should boot the host. The default.target file is only a symbolic link to the true target file. For a desktop workstation, this is typically going to be the graphical.target, which is equivalent to runlevel 5 in the old SystemV init. For a server, the default is more likely to be the multi-user.target.
In the init, tasks were initilized serially which resulted in lengthy booting time.  Systemd's clean, state forward and efficient design along with concurrent and parallel processing at boot helped to have a simple and time efficient boot process. Some of the other improved features include but not limited to â€¢  low memory footprints, event logging with journald..etc
